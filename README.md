# Minty

Minty is a website that demonstrates the Minty algorithm. Minty's algorithm is a method to find the shortest paths from the source to each of the vertices of the network.  


## Task


- develop a program that implements Minty's algorithm and check its operation;  
- develop a page (site) for popularization and distribution of the developed product on the Internet.


## Functionality

**Home page**  
On the main page of the site, we present our developers and the possibility of switching to other sections of the site.  


**Minty Algorithm**  
On this page, we display a visualization of how Minty's algorithm works. The user can input data and watch the algorithm work in real time.  


**Documentation**  
We provide a brief guide to using the site and an explanation of how Minty's algorithm works for users.  


## Technologies
TS + Angular  

## Usage:

1. By pressing the Seed button, the collected data will be filled. If you wish, you can fill in your own.

We get the graph.

2. By clicking on any node, the algorithm will start looking for the shortest path, and highlight it in green. The right will write the distance ("H: 16" in the screenshot).  
If the path is not found, a message will be displayed.

3. Also added a function to save the entered data to the browser's local storage.

Now we can choose the dataset we need from the list.
